# BTD6 Macros
I made these all from scratch in order to get xp for my monkeys, in order to get the paragons for them. The "xpfarmbtd6.ahk" one is just for grinding xp.

## Installation
You need ahk 2.0 for this, and after thats installed, double click the .ahk file. I might add the exe versions later but for now thats all there is.

## Usage
Once you have the file open, open BTD6 and on the main screen press '''ctrl P''' to start the script. It'll automatically navigate to the map,
 start the game, place the monkeys, loop, etc etc.
 
## Requirments
* AHK (obv)
* BTD6 (also obv)
* the following upgrade paths:
  * alchamst - 420
  * village - 222
  * ninja - 404
  * ace - 203
  * engineer - 433
  * sniper - 024
* the following maps:
  * monkey meadow - deflation
  * muddy puddles - deflation
  * infernal - deflation
* the default hotkeys - **THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR HOTKEYS HAVE BEEN CHANGED**
* a 1920x1080 resolution. - **there should be an option to change your resolution in settings, but i have not tested if that works**

and thats it good luck and have fun, submit an issue if yk, theres any issues, and ill try to fix them.
